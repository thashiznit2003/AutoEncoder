Linux Video Encoder – Transition Notes (Chat 5)

Repository/branch
- Repo: https://github.com/thashiznit2003/AutoEncoder (branch: main)
- Current version: 1.13.0

Latest changes (since chat4)
- Added SMB staging dir (/mnt/smb_staging) and Samba share `smbstaging`; installer/script + compose bind `./SMBStaging`.
- In-app HTTP Basic auth (configurable auth_user/auth_password), defaults admin/changeme.
- MakeMKV UI: registration key input, installed version display, update check (shows installed version), helper to generate host update command, copy button.
- SMB UI: staging copy, friendly mount labels, Enter-to-connect, wrapped status text, copy host update command.

Deployment one-liner (Ubuntu host)
- cd /linux-video-encoder/AutoEncoder/linux-video-encoder && git pull --ff-only && docker compose down && docker compose up -d --force-recreate
- MakeMKV host update helper: scripts/update_makemkv.sh (use MAKEMKV_VERSION env).
- SMB staging share helper: scripts/setup_smbstaging_share.sh.

Security notes (open)
- UI/API currently protected only by Basic auth; no TLS/CSRF/rate limiting.
- Container still privileged with broad device/mounts; should be reduced once optical/USB paths are known.
- SMB mount inputs are not heavily validated; credentials in cleartext.

Proposed next work (new chat)
- Split UI into main info page and Settings page (/settings) containing HandBrake, MakeMKV, Authentication panels and update helpers; main page remains informational with a Settings link.
- Consider tightening compose (drop privileged, limit devices/caps) after optical/USB hardware is available.

User preferences
- Always push to GitHub; provide host update one-liner in a code block.
- Versioning: bump patch for any change, minor for features, major on request; update changelog accordingly.
- Avoid destructive commands; keep changes reversible.
