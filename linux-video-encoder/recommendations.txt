4) Queue labeling: allow per-job label/comment (esp. for SMB-picked files) and show it in Active/Recent.
5) Staging: optional staging path for SMB copies, separate from /mnt/input, with a “preserve source” toggle.
7) Pause/resume/skip: queue-level pause/resume control and a “skip” that cancels a job without delete.
8) Per-job overrides: allow RF/encoder/audio overrides when queuing (manual/SMB) without changing defaults.
9) Error/retry policy: allow retry count or fallback order (e.g., NVENC → x264 fallback) via a flag.
10) Preserve source toggle: per-job control to keep originals (local and SMB) after success.
11) Hardware accel toggles: expose decode (nvdec/qsv/vaapi) and filter accel where supported.
12) Filters: deinterlace/detelecine/denoise/crop/scale presets; rotate/flip for odd sources.
13) Metadata/chapters: preserve or set title/chapters/metadata; option to keep chapter markers for non-disc files.
14) Container options: keep .mkv/.mp4/.m4v selection per job and add a faststart/moov relocation toggle for MP4.
18) Monitoring: add queued count indicator in header; show per-job encoder/hw decode info in Active.

Cybersecurity
- Add TLS termination (reverse proxy) and enforce HTTPS; keep UI/API off untrusted networks.
- CSRF protection and rate limiting (auth + API) with sensible auth/session timeouts.
- Harden compose: remove privileged, trim devices/capabilities, run non-root where possible.
- Input validation for SMB mount URLs/paths; avoid logging credentials; consider isolated mount helper.
- Secrets handling: move auth creds to env/secret files with strict perms; avoid baking secrets into images.
- HTTP headers: HSTS, X-Frame-Options/Frame-Deny, and a restrictive CSP by default.
